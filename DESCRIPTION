Title: Facilities for reading and working with CSS files in R
Description: This is an interface to libcroco for reading CSS
 files in R. This allows us to be able to understand the contents of a
 CSS document. We can also explicitly match styles to XML/HTML nodes
 to find which CSS elements will be applied to which XML/HTML nodes.
Note: libcroco is used in Inkscape and development is active there. 
    The changes there will hopefully be merged back into libcroco.
    So libcroco is a reasonable library to use for CSS parsing, but it does 
    have some bugs (case insensitive matching, handling of import nodes, page nodes).
