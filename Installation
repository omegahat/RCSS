Get libcroco from
  http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/sources/libcroco/0.6/libcroco-0.6.8.tar.xz
(or suitable URL for the version of interest)

You'll need glib, libxml2. glib needs gettext on some machines.

I install these in ~/local/
So use
 ./configure --prefix=$HOME/local

Set your path to include this:
[tcsh] set path = (~/local/bin $path)


After installing gettext in ~/local/, set

CFLAGS  -I$HOME/local/include
LDFLAGS  -L$HOME/local/lib

It can't hurt to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH (DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH on OS X) to
  $HOME/local/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}


I install libxml2 centrally, i.e. in /usr/local.

After installing gettext, glib, and libxml2, we can run configure
on libcroco. 
It doesn't find the new and glib and libxml2 in ~/local and /usr/local.
So I set
 CROCO_CFLAGS -I$HOME/local/include/glib-2.0
 CROCO_LIBS   -L$HOME/local/lib

Then
./configure --prefix=$HOME/local --disable-Bsymbolic
